# ASA Firewall Log Analyzer

This project is a Python-based tool for analyzing log files generated by Cisco ASA (Adaptive Security Appliance) firewalls. This script was developed for academic purposes and helps understand log analysis techniques used in network security, especially for Cisco firewall appliances.

## Features

- Paginate and display log file contents page by page
- Filter logs by severity level (0â€“7)
- Search for specific message patterns (e.g., `access-list acl_in permitted`)
- Compute the ratio of denied connections compared to total connections (`Deny` vs `permitted`)

## Requirements

- Python 3.x  
- No external libraries are required

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
  git clone https://github.com/eya2105/asa-firewall-log-analyzer.git  
  cd asa-firewall-log-analyzer
2. Replace the sample log file path with your own file path in log_analyzer.py:
   chemin_log = r"path/to/ASAFirewallLogSample.log"
3. Run the script:
  python log_analyzer.py
